# Data Analyst Nanodegree Project 2

In this project a European football dataset is investigated to gain insights into team and player performance and attributes.

Data is obtained from a variety of sources, such as FIFA game databases, as well as from third-party websites by web scraping. The dataset may be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer).

To run the analysis, open the Jupyter Notebook under the **Notebooks** folder, keeping the folder structure the same. Due to file size limitations, the dataset is not included. Download it from the link above, and place it in the root directory.
